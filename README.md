# 🌐 Harman Soni's Portfolio (Pure HTML, CSS, JS)

This is my first personal developer portfolio, handcrafted entirely using **pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** — with **no frameworks, no libraries, no Bootstrap**. It represents my early stage as a developer, where I built everything from the ground up to sharpen my fundamentals before moving into frameworks like React.

- **CSS3** – full custom styling, layout, and animations  
- **JavaScript** – light DOM manipulation (cursor animation, etc.)

## 🧱 Reflection

> "I didn’t start with React, Tailwind, or AI tools. I started with raw code, late nights, and problem-solving. That’s where my foundation was built."
